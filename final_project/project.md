## Introduction

>Summarize for us the goal of this project and how machine learning is useful in trying to accomplish it. As part of your answer, give some background on the dataset and how it can be used to answer the project question. Were there any outliers in the data when you got it, and how did you handle those? `relevant rubric items: “data exploration”, “outlier investigation”`

### Goal

Identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

### Why ML helps with this problem

Please think that you have become an audit team to deal with this problem. The data used for this problem contains tens of thousands of mails. How long will it take to grasp this manually?

Also, do not miss the problem, can you inject a lot of resources?

Machine learning solves these problems. Machine learning will find certain regularity from large amounts of data and identify cheaters. Also, you may discover something that people do not notice.z
